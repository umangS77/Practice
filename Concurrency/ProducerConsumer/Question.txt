Producer–Consumer Processing Pipeline Base:
Producer generates tasks, consumer processes them using a blocking queue.

Enhancements:
- Multi-stage pipeline (parse → transform → write)
- Backpressure when downstream is slow => already handled by blocking queue
- Graceful shutdown with poison pill / interrupt handling
- Retry with max retry count + dead letter queue
